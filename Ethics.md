# Project Dragonfly, Googleâ€™s censored search engine:  
I love the idea that employees can make a difference in what the companies they work for are involved in.     
I think a lot of the ideas the employees came up with were great. Especially having the company publish an ethical assessment for each project they do.    
When you actually have to justify something you plan to less chance that it will be un-ethical.  
As far as internet censorship I'm glad I don't live in China, but whos to say that we are right and they are wrong.   

# Self Driving car Ethic:  
These decisions that are discussed in the article are no win situations.  
I feel that that when a vehicle is making a decision and lives are at stake it should always favor the decision that would result in the least amount of casualties.   
After that shouldn't it prioritize it's owner? Or maybe even allow the purchaser of the car to decide how to prioritization will be handled in a life for a life scenario.  
To me the problem is that we are having to think about all crazy scenarios possible and make a decision ahead of time.  
Instead of just giving people drivers licenses and hoping that they make the right decision when confronted with one of these scenarios.   
It is easy for us to be scared of technology when having to make these decisions ahead of time but lets be honest the way we are doing it now isn't working.
